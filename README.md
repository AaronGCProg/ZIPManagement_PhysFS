# Assets ZIP Management with PhysicsFS

I am Aarón Guerrero, student of the Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM. This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer Marc Garrigó. This personal research seeks to reflect the knowledge acquired and share it with any one interested.


PhysicsFS is a library to provide abstract access to various archives. This makes for easy access to ZIP files in the same way as you access a file directly on the disk, and it makes it easy to ship a new archive that will override a previous archive on a per-file basis. Finally, PhysicsFS gives you platform-abstracted means to determine if CD-ROMs are available, the user's home directory, where in the real filesystem your program is running, etc.


You can find the project in: https://github.com/AaronGCProg/ZIPManagement_PhysFS

## DEMO

If you are testing the DEMO, or trying to know if you did well the exercises; here is the only input you will need:

Press "1" to check if the SFX is working.

The image of Geralt of Rivia and the random music at the background, are automatics. But I am sure that if one works, the rest will be working, because we are talking about a method that loads data into the project.


## Appreciation

I hope this content has been useful to you. You are free to take any of these advances for your own benefit.
