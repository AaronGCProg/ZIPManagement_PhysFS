# Assets ZIP Management with PhysicsFS

This project is carried out by Aar√≥n Guerrero, student of the Bachelor's degree in Video Game Design and Developmen at Terrasa, CITM, UPC. This personal research seeks to reflect the knowledge acquired and share it with any one interested.

You can find the project in: https://github.com/AaronGCProg/ZIPManagement_PhysFS

## DEMO

If you are testing the DEMO, or trying to know if you did well the exercises; here is the only input you will need:

Press "1" to check if the SFX is working.
